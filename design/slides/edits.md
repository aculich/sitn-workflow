Here is the slide-by-slide edit transcript based on the audio commentary in the video and the visual cues in the PDF.

### **Slide-by-Slide Edit-Change Transcript**

**General Note on Slide Order:**
The audio requests a structural change to the flow of the presentation. The **Original Slide 3** ("Our Current Process is Strained...") should be moved to appear **after Original Slide 4** ("Visualizing the Current Weekly Production Cycle") to mirror the flow of the team's conversation,.

The transcript below follows the **Target New Order**.

---

**Title:** Transforming the Studies in the News Workflow

**Title:** Our Work Informs California’s Most Influential Leaders
**Action:** Update Subscriber Count.
