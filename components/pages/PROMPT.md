PROMPT.md


Based on the markdown documents in /Users/me/projects/peeq-crb-nexus/sitn-workflow/design please generate a new nextjs app in the the @sitn-workflow folder targeting the @sitn-workflow/design/TECHSTACK.md  and first writeup in the @design `sitn-workflow/design` folder a EXECSUMMARY.md, PRD.md, FEATURES.md, SPEC.md, PLAN.md and TODO.md and once those documents are all in place in `sitn-workflow/design` then go ahead with building out the app in the `sitn-workflow/` using the context7 mcp to guide the code generation so it is correct, and once a full enough first draft with working UI/UX elements is working, then start the app on a free open port and `open` the browser @Browser so I can review what you've created.

Don't ask me for confirmation as we go, just do it and commit along the way in the repo for @sitn-workflow in that subdir itself
